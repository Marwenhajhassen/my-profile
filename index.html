        <p class="home-desc"> The U.S. government on Wednesday said the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as&nbsp; Volt Typhoon &nbsp;had been embedded into some critical infrastructure networks in the country for at least five years. Targets of the threat actor include communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater systems sectors in the U.S. and Guam. "Volt Typhoon's choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations, and the U.S. authoring agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement to OT assets to disrupt functions," the U.S. government&nbsp; said . The joint advisory, which was released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was also backed by other nations that are part of the Five Eyes (FVEY) intelligence all</p>

            <span class="h-tags">Unified Identity / Cyber Security</span>
        </h5>
        <p class="home-desc"> If you've listened to software vendors in the identity space lately, you will have noticed that "unified" has quickly become the buzzword that everyone is adopting to describe their portfolio. And this is great! Unified identity has some amazing benefits!&nbsp; However (there is always a however, right?) not every "unified" "identity" "security" "platform" is made equal. Some vendors call the combination of workforce IDaaS and customer IDaaS a unified identity solution, while others offer a glorified 2FA service – unified only in the mind of their marketers.&nbsp; Your landscape matters! &nbsp; So forget for a moment what the vendors claim, and think back to&nbsp; your &nbsp;organization and&nbsp; your &nbsp; identity security &nbsp;landscape. Consider this new definition: "unified" is what has the ability to consolidate your identity challenges with a complete identity solution.&nbsp; Here's an example: you're responsible for the identity infrastructure of a large hospital. </p>
